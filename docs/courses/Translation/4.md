早在战国时期，人们就发现了磁力，并用磁石制造了世界上最早的指南针。汉朝时期，人们制造了一种形如勺子的指南针。这是一个磁石制的勺子，勺子底很平滑，置于一个四方形的铜盘上。盘子中心很光滑，因此勺子可以很容易地转动。勺子停止转动后，勺柄所指的方向就是南方。这种指南针在宋朝时期得到了改进。人们制造了铁针，把这些铁针在一块磁石上摩擦，使他们具有磁性。然后将他们用一根细线吊起来，或是将他们置于一些可以漂浮在一碗水上的轻物体上。后来，这种用法首先在航海中使用。中国是第一个在海船上使用指南针的国家。



In 105, the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cai Lun began to make paper. But recently, people have found the paper made in Western Han Dynasty. People believe that papermaking have been invented during Western Han Dynasty, and Cai Lun simply improved this technology. Later, people used different materials to make paper, which makes the quality of paper better. In the Tang Dynasty, Xuan paper produced in Xuanzhou, Anhui was very famous. People began to use bamboo to make paper in the Song Dynasty, and the production increased rapidly. In 751, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, papermaking was introduced to Arabia, and then to Europe from Arabia in 1150. That is to say, Europe was late for more than 1000 years than China to know how to make paper.

- 中国的教育思想，把教育只看成“传道授业”，在中国历史上，这种教育观念是根深蒂固的。
- There is a deep-rooted educational idea/philosophy that education is regarded as "transmission of knowledge and moral principles" in Chinese history. 

Because of yesterday's hours of rain and today's sunny weather, I walked to the west bank of the lake to see the scenery after the rain.
