# Shift registers
## Shift 4
```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input areset,  // async active-high reset to zero
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [3:0] data,
    output reg [3:0] q); 
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 4'b0000;  // Reset q to 0
        end else if (load) begin
            q <= data;  // Load the data into q
        end else if (ena) begin
            q <= q >> 1;  // Shift q right by 1 when enabled
        end
    end
endmodule
```
**How dose it work when both ena and load are 1?**
In the Verilog code you provided, the condition where both `load` and `ena` are high is handled by the **sequential priority** of the `if-else` statements. Here's how it works:

1. **`if (areset)`**: This takes the highest priority because it's the first condition checked. If `areset` is high, the output `q` is reset to `4'b0000`, regardless of the states of `load` or `ena`.

2. **`else if (load)`**: This is checked next. If `areset` is not active and `load` is high, `q` will be loaded with the value of `data`. This happens **even if `ena` is also high**. The `load` operation takes priority over the enable (`ena`) because it comes before it in the `else if` chain.

3. **`else if (ena)`**: This block is only executed if both `areset` is low and `load` is low. In this case, if `ena` is high, the value of `q` will be right-shifted. However, this will not happen if `load` is also high, as the `load` condition would already have been executed, skipping the `ena` block.

### Summary of `load` and `ena` behavior:
- If both `load` and `ena` are high at the same time, **`load` takes priority**. `q` will be loaded with `data`, and the `ena` block (right shift) will not execute.
- If only `ena` is high, the right shift operation will take place.
  
This ensures that when `load` is asserted, it overrides the enable behavior, preventing simultaneous conflicting operations.
